                <hr>
                <h5 style="text-align: center;">I was born at Adana Devlet Hastanesi in Adana,1996. I have two siblings.
                    My elder brother is Evren. He is 30. He works at engineering firm as a responsible for information processing.
                    He is married since 4 years. He has a son. He is two years. My littyle sister is Güneş. She is 23.
                    She is studying Çukurova University. Her department is nurse. My mom is Dünya. She is 48. She is housewife.
                    My father is Yusuf. He is 55. He is retired.

                <hr>        
                <h5 style="text-align: center;">I studied primary school partly in Adana and partly in Ankara. I was very good at math with a big difference to other subjects.
                    I was also very good at chess. I was very confident in chess. After I improved myself, I almost lost to no one until I joined the tournament.
                     In the tournament I participated in, I placed 2nd and won gram gold. But I was very upset that I could not win in my last match.

                <hr>  
                    <h5>I studied high school in vocational high school. My score was not bad, but because I did not know where to go and how to research,
                    I involuntarily continued on such a path. I studied electrical and electronics technology in high school.
                    After graduating, I took a break from school for three years and worked as a worker in some places.
                    When I decided to study again, I won a 2-year department at Başkent University.</h5></div>

                <hr>
            <h5>I started to study Electronic Technology at Başkent University in 2017. When I was in my second year, I started looking for a job. Around that time, I had heard of something 
                called the "Dikey Geçiş Sınavı" and started researching it. I took a practice exam to test myself, and thinking that I could do something, 
                I studied for the exam and won METU  Computer Education and Instruction Technology.</h5></div>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span>Licence University</span></h3>
                <hr>
                <h5>I started the Computer and Instructional Technologies department in 2019, and unfortunately, in the second period of the preparation, 
                    the "pandemic" came into play and schools were turned to distance education. Due to the pandemic,
                     the preparation exam was made a little easier and I managed to pass the department in my first year with difficulty.
                      I am currently in the third year and I am continuing the department. I am trying to improve myself with the help of my valuable teachers.
                      I think if I can improve myself well, I want to continue my life in the software part. There may a few problems in this website, but of course they will be overcome. :)
